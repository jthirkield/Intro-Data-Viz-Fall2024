### PSAM 5010 Syllabus, Fall 2024
CRN 5884

MON 7:00 â€“ 9:40PM | 6 East 16th Street. Room: 1208

INSTRUCTOR: Jonathan Thirkield, jthirkield@newschool.edu

**Course Description:** This is a seminal course on information design and aesthetics. Students will study graphical theory, graph grammar, and investigate hierarchies, patterns, and relationships in data structures. Students will examine the role of scale, proportion, color, form, structure, motion, and composition in data visualization. Using computational methods, students will create drawings, graphs, indexes, and maps that explore the database as cultural form. The function of this course is to build a community among the students and orient them to the whole program.

**Learning Outcomes:**

By the successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Understand the various methods and techniques of modern data visualization along with its historical origins.
2. Design and critique visual communication and information displays.
3. Describe, analyze, and evaluate various data visualization approaches.
4. Implement data visualizations using web technologies including D3, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
5. Explore creative possibilities for visualization and knowledge generation
